- 👋 Hi, I’m Roger, a veteran in I.T., mostly obsolete and not taking himself seriously.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a website, self-hosted. It has been playtested with printed components (in my basement!) and now it is mature for porting it to Internet. This is a turn-based videogame where one develops a dungeon layout, digging tunnels, populating specialized rooms with creatures of the under world, digging for food and gold. After some time, your dungeon will breach the dungeon of another dark lord (or you'll be suddenly invaded) and, as if it was not enough, soon the goodie-two-shoes paladins of the Sun land, above the dungeon level, will dive into your rooms, vandalizing and killing your minion. Those heroes will pick up your treasure, carefully hidden in the darkness. They will fight even better when equipped with magic weapons and benevolent spells. But, if they run out of torch and lanterns then they won't see far in the dark. You can even capture some for later conversion to your cause. The good and the bad factions have quests to fulfill. You can research spells, build traps and doors, barter with the other dark lords and sponsor anonymously some good guys of the Sun land to invade your rival dark lords.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning iis10, ASP.NET 9, SQL Server Express 2016, Visual Studio MVC and C#. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaborators to embark on this dream of mine, and possibly partners if the thingy eventually works and is fun to play. One never knows where a dream can lead.

- ⚡ Fun fact: at one point, the whole basement was occupied by square meters and square meters of dungeon layouts, preventing access to the middle of the room!
