- 👋 Hi, I’m Roger, a veteran in I.T., mostly obsolete and not taking himself seriously.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a website, self-hosted. It has been playtested with printed components (in my basement!) and now it is mature for porting it to Internet. This is a turn-based videogame where one develops a dungeon layout, digging tunnels, populating specialized rooms with creatures of the under world. After some time, your dungeon will breach the dungeon of another dark lord (or you'll be suddenly invaded)and the goodie-two-shoes paladins and heroes of the Sun land will dive into your dungeon. Mayhem will spread.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning ASP.NET 9, SQL Server Express 2016, Visual Studio MVC and C#. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaborators to embark on this dream of mine, and possibly partners if the thingy eventually works and is fun to play. One never knows where a dream can lead.
- 📫 How to reach me? On Discord at roger_b
- 😄 Pronouns: he
- ⚡ Fun fact: at one point, the whole basement was occupied by square meters and square meters of dungeon layouts, preventing access to the middle of the room!
